 * Whether a newer build has been published, and when it is time to look again.

 * <p>The repository keeps one line of text, {@code dist/latest.txt}, holding the newest version's name.
 * That line is all that is ever read: nothing is sent with the request, nothing is downloaded, and the
 * app never installs anything. It only says so, and the person decides.
 *
 * <p>Two questions are answered here, away from the screen so they can be tested. Is the published version
 * really later than this one - not merely different, which is what the first check asked, and which told
 * a phone running a build newer than the repository that an older one "has been published". And has it
 * been long enough since the last look, so that a pad opened forty times a day asks once.
 *
 * <p>Holds no Android types, so it is unit tested.
